          I'm a fullstack developer who is a self motivated team player. I enjoy
          learning new tech, but acknowledge that these technologies are just
          tools in a tool belt, a means to deliver great software products. I
          love writing tests, reviewing code and testing to ensure my team is
          always delivering great code. I have experience in many programming
          languages, which facilitates my ability to adopt new technology
          quickly by seeing the commonalities between them. I'm no security
          expert, but I know the basics of keeping a website secure.

          I graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor of Applied
          Science in Honours Nanotechnology Engineering. I chose this program
          because I was interested in chemistry and wanted to apply my learnings
          to solve problems and improve lives. However, the actual day to day
          work of being in a lab was not enjoyable for me, so I branched out a
          bit during my coop placements, and learned that I could build amazing
          things using software from my own computer. Starting from about
          halfway through my program, I switched my focus to software, taking as
          many software courses as the school would let me. I have been
          self-directing my learning ever since. I believe that this round about
          path has made me a better professional developer to this day because
          it forced me to learn how to learn.
