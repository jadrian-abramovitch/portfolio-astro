        I'm a fullstack developer who is a self motivated team player. I enjoy
        learning new tech, but acknowledge that these technologies are just
        tools in a tool belt, a means to deliver great software products. I love
        writing tests, reviewing code and testing to ensure my team is always
        delivering great code. I have experience in many programming languages,
        which facilitates my ability to adopt new technology quickly by seeing
        the commonalities between them. I'm no security expert, but I know the
        basics of keeping a website secure.

        I graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor of Applied
        Science in Honours Nanotechnology Engineering. I chose this program
        because I was interested in chemistry and wanted to apply my learnings
        to solve problems and improve lives. However, the actual day to day work
        of being in a lab was not enjoyable for me, so I branched out a bit
        during my coop placements, and learned that I could build amazing things
        using software from my own computer. Starting from about halfway through
        my program, I switched my focus to software, taking as many software
        courses as the school would let me. I have been self-directing my
        learning ever since. I believe that this round about path has made me a
        better professional developer to this day because it forced me to learn
        how to learn.
